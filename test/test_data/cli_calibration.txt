usage: fetchMGs.py calibration [-h] [-c C [C ...]] [-o O] [-l L] [-p] [-d D]
                               [-v] [-i] [-t T] [-x X]
                               file map

positional arguments:
  file                  file with sequences that include marker genes (true positives)
  map                   tab-delimited file with true positive protein identifiers and COG ID

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c C [C ...], -cog_used C [C ...]
                        orthologous group id(s) to be extracted; example: "COG0012"
  -o O, -outdir O       output directory
  -l L, -library L      path to directory that contains hmm models
  -p, -protein          set if nucleotide sequences file for <protein sequences> is not available
  -d D, -dnaFastaFile D
                        multi-FASTA file with nucleotide sequences; not neccesary if protein and nucleotide fasta file have the same name except .faa and .fna suffixes
  -v, -verybesthit_only
                        only extract the best hit of each COG from each genome
                        recommended to use, if extracting sequences from multiple reference genomes in the same file do not use it for metagenomes
                        if this option is set fasta identifiers should be in the form: taxID.geneID and, if needed, have "project_id=XXX" in the header
                        alternatively, set -i to ignore the headers; then, the best hit of each OG in the whole input file will be selected, regardless of the headers used
  -i, -ignore_headers   if this option is set in addition to -v, the best hit of each COG will be selected
                        recommended to use, if extracting sequences from a single genome in the same file
  -t T, -threads T      number of processors/threads to be used
  -x X, -executable X   path to executables used by this script
                        default is bin/
                        if set to '' will search for executables in $PATH
